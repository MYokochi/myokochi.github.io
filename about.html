          <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹<br>I'm Margarida, a product designer based in Europe.</p>
          <p> For the past year, I have been working in Prague, helping a company shift from providing software services to developing an in house product!<br>I'm passionate about creating systems and collaborating with my team to solve complex problems. I thrive on challenges and constantly look for opportunities to grow and improve my skills.<br>In my free time, I love exploring the great outdoors. You can usually find me cycling, wandering through the forest.</p>
          <p>If you're interested in working with me or have any questions about my design process, please feel free to get in touch. I look forward to collaborating with you!</p>
