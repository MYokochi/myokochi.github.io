    <h1>A Little About Me ✨</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <div>
          <p>I'm Margarida, a product designer based in Europe.</p>
          <p> I've been working in Prague, helping a company shift from providing software services to developing a 3D configurator product in-house!<br>I'm all about creating systems that improve workflow and collaboration with others. I thrive on challenges and constantly look for opportunities to grow and improve my skills.</p>
          <p>In my free time, I love exploring the great outdoors. You can usually find me cycling, wandering through the forest.</p>
          <p>If you're interested in working with me or have any questions about my design process, please feel free to get in touch. I look forward to collaborating with you!</p>
